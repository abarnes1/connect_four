# Connect Four
This is the Connect Four project created as part of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

Key skills:
- Test driven development
  - Design public interfaces necessary for objects
  - Write tests for public interfaces that determine whether they are behaving as expected
  - Implement public interfaces with chosen implementation
- Testing with RSpec
  - Use arrange, act, assert pattern to write tests
  - Using doubles to isolate tested behavior to the class and/or function under test
